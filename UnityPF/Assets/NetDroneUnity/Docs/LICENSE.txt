Certain words or phrases are defined to have certain meanings when used in this Agreement. Those words and phrases are defined below in Section 21.

If you are separately licensed by Origin Studio ('Origin') under a Custom License, certain terms of this Agreement do not apply to your Custom Products. Those terms are described below in Section 22.

#
# 1. License Grant
#
Origin grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable (except as described in this Agreement) license for a single User to use, reproduce, display, perform, and modify the Licensed Technology for any lawful purpose (the "License"). However, the rights that Origin grants you under the License are subject to the terms of this Agreement, and you may only make use of the License if you comply with all applicable terms.

The License becomes effective on the date you accept this Agreement or download the Engine Code or any Content. The License does not grant you any title or ownership in the Licensed Technology.

Allowed forms of Distribution and Sublicensing

You may only Distribute the Licensed Technology as follows:

a. Distribution to end users - You may Distribute the Licensed Technology incorporated in object code format only as an inseparable part of a Product to end users who are subject to an end user license agreement which explicitly disclaims any representations, warranties, conditions, and liabilities related to the Licensed Technology. The Product may not contain any Engine Tools or any Marketplace Content Distributed in uncooked source format.

b. Distribution to other licensees - You may Distribute Engine Code (including as modified by you under the License) in Source Code or object code format, or any Content, to an Engine Licensee who has rights under its license to the same Version of the Engine Code or Content that you are Distributing.

You also may Distribute Content to an Engine Licensee who is your employee or your contractor regardless of whether they have rights under their license to the same Content, but only to permit that Engine Licensee to utilize that Content in good faith to develop a Product on your behalf for Distribution by you under the License, and not for the purpose of Content pooling or any other Distribution or sublicensing of Content that is not permitted under this Agreement. Recipients of such a Distribution have a limited license to use, reproduce, display, perform, and modify that Content to develop your Product as outlined above, and for no other purpose.

c. Distribution and sublicensing of Examples - You may Distribute or sublicense Examples (including as modified by you under the License) in Source Code or object code format to any third party. However, the rights in this Section 1(c) do not expand or modify your limited Distribution and sublicensing rights for Engine Code and Content (including as modified by you under the License) that are not Examples.

You are permitted to post snippets of Engine Code, up to 30 lines of code in length, online in public forums for the sole purpose of discussing the content of the snippet and not for the purpose of enabling non-Engine Licensees to use or modify any Engine Code, or to aggregate, recombine, or reconstruct any larger portion of the Engine Code.

You may not sublicense the Licensed Technology in Source Code format. You may not sublicense the Licensed Technology in object code format, or any Content, except to grant end users the ability to use, or to permit your publishers and distributors to market and Distribute, a Product that you Distribute as permitted in Section 1(a) above. This paragraph does not limit your rights to Distribute and sublicense Examples.

Other Restrictions

Non-Compatible Licenses

You may not combine, Distribute, or otherwise use the Licensed Technology with any code or other content which is covered by a license that would directly or indirectly require that all or part of the Licensed Technology be governed under any terms other than those of this Agreement ("Non-Compatible License"). Code or content under the following licenses, for example, are prohibited: GNU General Public License (GPL), Lesser GPL (LGPL) (unless you are merely dynamically linking a shared library), or Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License. Code or content under the following licenses, for example, are allowed: BSD License, MIT License, Microsoft Public License, or Apache License. You may not sublicense the Licensed Technology under a Non-Compatible License.

#
# 2. User License
#
The Licensed Technology is licensed to you for use by a single User. The User may store the Licensed Technology on any of the User's computers, but the Licensed Technology cannot be shared with others (including any other employees or agents) except through a permitted Distribution as described above. 

In order to access and download the Engine Code and Content, you must set up an Account. You may not share or allow others to use your Account. You are responsible for the security of your Account. For questions regarding your Account, please go to www.vogie.net/contact.

Under the License, the User may use the Licensed Technology for as long as you comply with this Agreement. If you are a legal entity, references to "you" in this agreement also apply to the User in all cases. You are responsible for the User's compliance with this Agreement. 

If you are an Academic Institution, the limitation to use by a single User does not apply with respect to the Licensed Technology. Instead, you may store the Licensed Technology on any of your computers, and you may allow all users of those computers to use the Licensed Technology (excluding any Marketplace Content) under the License. However, those users are not authorized under your License to Distribute or sublicense the Licensed Technology (including as incorporated in a Product) unless they obtain a License of their own.

#
# 3. New Versions and Content
#
During the term of your License, you will be entitled to access future Versions of the Engine Code and new Content that Origin chooses to make available to you. Origin does not have any obligation to make new Versions of the Engine Code or new Content available. Nor does Origin have any obligation to continue to make available for access or download any or all Versions of the Engine Code or Content. However, any Versions of the Engine Code and Content that Origin has made available to you, and for which you have accepted any applicable amendment to this Agreement as described in Section 21, are considered part of the Licensed Technology and may be used under the License (as amended by that amendment).

However, you may continue to freely use any Feedback that you provide to Origin, and you may continue to use, in any manner consistent with the License, any Contribution that you make available to Origin.

You understand and agree that Origin is not required to make any use of any Feedback or Contribution that you provide. You agree that if Origin makes use of your Feedback or Contribution, Origin is not required to credit or compensate you for your contribution.
